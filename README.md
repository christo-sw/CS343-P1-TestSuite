# CS344 Project 1 Test Suite
This test suite is intended for preliminary testing, as we will apparently be getting an official test suite at a later time.

# How to install
First, clone the repository to any place on your system
```bash
git clone https://github.com/christo-sw/CS343-P1-TestSuite.git
```

Navigate into the cloned repository
```bash
cd CS343-P1-TestSuite
```

If you do not already have virtualenv installed on your system, do this next
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
```

Next, create a virtual environment in the current directory
```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

Activate the virtual environment
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

Install the test suite requirements
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
